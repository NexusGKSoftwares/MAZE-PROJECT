## Project Overview
Welcome to the Maze Generation and Solving project! This innovative application utilizes the power of C++ and the SDL2 library to generate captivating random mazes. By employing a randomized depth-first search algorithm, it creates intricate maze patterns, while the A* pathfinding algorithm elegantly visualizes the solution from start to finish. With an intuitive interface and engaging graphics, this project showcases the beauty of algorithms in action.

## Features
- **Dynamic Maze Generation:** Experience the thrill of watching a random maze come to life through a depth-first search algorithm.
- **Intuitive Pathfinding Visualization:** Witness the A* algorithm as it expertly navigates the maze, illuminating the path from start to exit.
- **Customizable Maze Size:** Tailor your experience by adjusting the size of the maze to your preference.
- **Image-Based Navigator:** Replace the traditional circle navigator with a visually appealing image that indicates the current position in the maze.
- **Interactive User Experience:** Enjoy a seamless interface that makes exploring the maze both fun and engaging.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Graphics Library:** SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code or any C++ IDE of your choice
- **Build Tools:** CMake or Makefiles (as applicable)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
To get started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- The SDL2 development libraries
- The SDL2_image library (for loading various image formats)

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install SDL2:**
   - **On Ubuntu:**
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev
     ```
   - **On Windows:** Download the SDL2 development libraries from the [SDL website](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and follow the installation instructions provided.

3. **Build the Project:**
   Create a build directory and compile the code:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   Execute the generated binary to see the magic unfold:
   ```bash
   ./maze_solver
   ```

5. **Prepare an Image:**
   Make sure you have an image file named `image.png` located in the same directory as the executable. This image will serve as the navigator within the maze.

## Code Explanation

### Structure
The code is organized into several components, each playing a vital role in the maze generation and solving process.

#### 1. Point Struct
The `Point` struct represents a coordinate in the maze grid, encapsulating both `x` and `y` values. It features overloaded operators for easy comparison.

#### 2. Maze Class
The heart of the project lies within the `Maze` class, which includes methods for generating, drawing, solving, and moving the navigator through the maze.

- **Constructor:** Initializes the maze size and triggers the maze generation process.
- **generateMaze():** Implements a randomized depth-first search algorithm to create the maze structure.
- **draw():** Renders the maze walls and the solution path on the screen.
- **solveMaze():** Utilizes the A* algorithm to determine the optimal path from the start point to the exit.
- **moveNavigator():** Visualizes the movement of the navigator image along the calculated solution path.

#### 3. Main Function
The main entry point of the application, responsible for initializing SDL, creating the maze, solving it, and managing user interactions.

### Key Functions and Algorithms
- **Randomized Depth-First Search:** A recursive algorithm that generates the maze by exploring random paths and backtracking when necessary.
- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm:** An efficient algorithm that finds the shortest route from the start to the goal using heuristics.

## Usage
Upon launching the application, a captivating maze will be generated and displayed. After a brief pause, the solution path will be revealed in green, guiding you through the maze. The navigator image will dynamically move along this path, providing a visual representation of the solution journey.

## Future Improvements
This project has immense potential for growth. Here are a few ideas for future enhancements:
- **Implement Alternative Maze Generation Algorithms:** Explore options like Prim's or Kruskal's algorithms for generating diverse maze structures.
- **User-Defined Maze Size and Difficulty Levels:** Allow users to customize their experience by selecting maze dimensions and difficulty settings.
- **Enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Improve interactivity with a more polished user interface.
- **User-Controlled Navigation:** Enable users to navigate the maze manually for a more immersive experience.
- **Maze Saving and Loading Functionality:** Allow users to save generated mazes and revisit them later.
